\chapter{Tests and Benchmarks}\label{chap:test}
\begin{mybox}
After the presentation of the main theoretical contents, this chapter is going to show some results of the implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison of several reachability analyzers (Chapter \ref{chap:refinement}): exhaustive reachability analyzers, Pint, PermReach, ASPReach on their scalability (biggest tractable model size), efficiency (runtime) and precision (global conclusiveness)
    \item Running examples of CRAC and M2RIT (Chapter \ref{chap:modelInference})
\end{itemize}
\end{mybox}

We have shown the theoretical effectiveness and correctness of PermReach and ASPReach in Chapter \ref{chap:refinement}. 
To ensure their capacity, we use small models to verify the correctness, i.e. PermReach and ASPReach obtain the same result as other tools, then we apply all the analyzers on a series of models with growing sizes to obtain the limit of the capacity of each analyzer.

As for CRAC and M2RIT, CRAC uses reachability properties and \textit{continuous} time-series data while M2RIT uses reachability properties and \textit{discretized} time-series data.


\section{Comparison of Reachability Analyzers}
In this section, we evaluate the reachability analyzers through various experiments.
All tests were run on a Intel Core i7-3770 CPU, \@3.4GHz with 8Gb RAM computer.

To validate our approach, we first carried tests on a small model, $\lambda$-phage model \cite{thieffry1995dynamical} to compare with an alternative reachability analyzer Pint \cite{pauleve2012} implementing solely analysis using SLCG \cite{pauleve2017reduction,folschette2015,pauleve2011}.
In this model with 4 automata and 12 transitions (without taking consideration of the self-regulations),
our result shows complete conclusiveness while Pint cannot (Figure \ref{fig:LCG_lambdaPhage}). %able to figure out the reachability of $cro_1$ when $cl_1$ and $cll_1$ are in the initial state (Figure \ref{fig:LCG_lambdaPhage}).
PermReach \cite{chai2018heuristic} is not able either to handle some of the special cases where multiple states of one automaton appear in different branches (Figure \ref{fig:countexPerm}).
Theses cases are solvable by ASPReach.
The whole approach is implemented in Python3\footnote{Code and testing data available at \url{https://github.com/XinweiChai/LCG-in-ASP}}.
The call of ASP is done by package \textit{pyasp}\footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyasp}}. 
%In big examples TCR and EGFR, it outputs the sequence from initial state towards final state.
%More importantly, it gives decidable reachability for any input.

    \caption[SLCG of $\lambda$-phage model]{One SLCG of $\lambda$-phage model, automaton $cl$ appears in both branches of the \textbf{AND gate}. Static analyzer Pint cannot decide whether in this case $cro_1$ is reachable or not, because it does not consider the order in the state sequence even though there exists a solution is of length 3: $cll_0::cl_0::cro_1$ corresponding to the trajectory $\acm{cl_1}{cll_1}{cll_0}::\acm{cll_0}{cl_1}{cl_0}::\acm{cll_0,cl_0}{cro_0}{cro_1}$.}

    \caption[Counterexample of PermReach]{This counterexample shows former PermReach is inconclusive if multiple states of one automaton appear in the branches of one \textbf{AND gate} ($d_0$ and $d_1$ in this example). 
    However there exists a consistent state sequence: $d_1::b_1::c_1::a_1$ corresponding to the trajectory $\acm{c_0}{d_0}{d_1}::\acm{d_0,a_0}{b_0}{b_1}::\acm{d_1,e_0}{c_0}{c_1}::\acm{b_1,c_1}{a_0}{a_1}$ which could be found by ASPReach.}\label{fig:countexPerm}
\end{figure}

To evaluate the scalability in \textit{in silico} networks, we take T-cell Receptor model (TCR) \cite{saez2007logical} and epidermal growth factor receptor model (EGFR) \cite{samaga2009logic} as examples, with the former one containing 95 automata and 206 transitions and the latter one containing 104 automata and 389 transitions respectively. 

These models are originally Boolean networks.
According to the approach in Appendix \ref{appendix:trans}, BNs are transformed into ABANs. 
Here, we ran the same test as in \cite{folschette2015}. In the TCR model, we take 3 automata as input (\texttt{cd4 cd28 tcrlig}), varying exhaustively their initial states combinations ($2^3$), take the reachability of states of 5 automata (\texttt{sre ap1 nfkb nfat sigmab}) as output. 
Similarly we carried a bigger test on EGFR model with 13 automata %\footnote{\texttt{erbb1 erbb2 erbb3 erbb4 bir btc egf epr nrg1a nrg1b nrg2b nrg4 tgfa}}
as input and 12 automata %\footnote{\texttt{elk1 creb ap1 hsp27 actin\_reorg cmyc pro\_apoptotic p70s6\_2 pkc stat1 stat3 stat5}}
as output.
We first tested the performance of traditional model checkers, Mole\footnote{\url{http://www.lsv.fr/~schwoon/tools/mole}} and NuSMV\footnote{\url{http://nusmv.fbk.eu}}, in which Mole turns out to be memory-out for 6 in 12 outputs, and all memory-out for NuSMV in model EGFR. 
Due to the big state space, traditional model checkers are not applicable.
In the TCR tests, our approach gives exactly the same result as Pint did. 
As for EGFR tests, ASPReach returned no inconclusive output.

}\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

As seen in Table \ref{tab:results}, our approach can be more conclusive than Pint for ABANs.
In the configuration of heuristics, we set a threshold for \textbf{OR gates}.
If there are less than 10 \textbf{OR gates} after preprocessing, the computation will be shifted from heuristic to the enumeration of all combinations of \textbf{OR gates}.
%It is acceptable for such a model, i.e. at most $2^{10}$ paths to check. 
Here is the case for these three benchmarks. The experiments show the ability of ASPReach is already more conclusive than Pint in ``simple'' cases.

Besides the tests done by others, we also carry tests on some randomly generated ABANs to check the generality and the time-performance of PermReach. 
Given the number of transitions, for every transition $tr$, the head $a_h$ is randomly chosen from $\mathbf{LS}$, the first element of the body $A_1$ is chosen from $\mathbf{LS}_1=\mathbf{LS}\setminus \{a_h,a_{1-h}\}$.
For $i>1$, if $A_{i-1}=b_x$ exists, we generate $A_i$ with an 80\% probability, choosing from $\mathbf{LS}_i=\mathbf{LS}_{i-1}\setminus \{b_x,b_{1-x}\}$. 
 
One test is on the different numbers of automata with the same density (average number of transitions per automaton) of ABAN. Fixing the density to 3, we vary the number of automata from $10,20,\ldots,100,200,\ldots,1000$.
In the instances with less than 300 automata, the runtime of each reachability check is less than 0.1s.
Figure \ref{fig:sizeTest} and Figure \ref{fig:sizeTest} shows the average runtime is less than 5 seconds even if there are 1000 automata. 
Moreover, the longest runtime among the test sets is less than 20s. 
Because we stop the computation if one reachability check takes more than 20s and we note it as timeout.
We find no timeout case.

Another test is on the different density with the same number of automata. 
In Figure \ref{fig:inconcTest}, we fixed $|\Sigma|=20$ and vary the number of the transitions per automaton (density) from 1 to 12.
The runtime peak is at density 8, a possible explanation is that even the topology of the network is more complex with the growth of density, more available transitions lead to more pathways from the initial state to the target state, thus the heuristics may end with less trials.
